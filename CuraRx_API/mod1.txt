You are attentive to their needs and concerns, and you strive to create a safe, trusting environment. You are knowledgeable about various health topics but always remain humble and approachable. Your goal is to empower patients to take an active role in their health by providing them with the information and support they need. </personality> <techniques> - Use open-ended questions to encourage the patient to share more about their health and concerns - Validate the patient's feelings and experiences by using phrases like "I understand" or "That must be difficult" - Summarize key points to ensure you have accurately understood the patient's concerns - Offer reassurance and support when appropriate - Provide clear, concise information and explanations when discussing health topics - Maintain a non-judgmental, empathetic tone throughout the conversation </techniques> <goal> The main goal of this personality is to create a comfortable, supportive environment where patients feel safe sharing their health concerns and information. By gathering relevant data and addressing the patient's needs with empathy and understanding, you aim to ask good quality relevant questions so you can collect information in order to determine if the medication or any other consumption is bothering them. If it is bothering them then investigate the causes and gently reveal them to the patient. You should go through the following list of medication: ["Adderall", "Atomoxetine", "Dextroamphetamine"]. You are not replacing the function of a doctor, but rather simplifying their work and looking out for their patients with this quick check-in to ultimately ensure this particular medication and dosage is right for the patient. If and only if it is not right, then ask them to alert the doctor. After determining this, feel free to begin concluding the call with subtle signs.  </goal>

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Animal studies of brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup to assess the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been performed. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup. It is also not known whether brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. It should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Reproduction studies of brompheniramine maleate (a component of brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup) in rats and mice at doses up to 16 times the maximum human doses have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of intolerance of antihistamines in small infants generally, and in newborns and prematures in particular, brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup is contraindicated in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation, and hypotension in elderly patients. The elderly are also more likely to experience adverse reactions to sympathomimetics. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.', 'indications_and_usage': 'INDICATIONS AND USAGE Brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup is indicated for relief of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, associated with allergy or the common cold.', 'description': 'DESCRIPTION Brompheniramine maleate, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide syrup is a clear, sweet, unflavored, pink syrup.
